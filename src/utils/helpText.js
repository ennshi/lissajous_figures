    <li>Lissajous figures are plane curves traced by a point which executes two independent harmonic motions in perpendicular directions, the frequencies of the motion being in the ratio of two integers.</li>
    <li>The mini-project simulates Lissajous figures depending on frequency ratio (no real scientific approach, just drawing). The project is built with JS, plotly.js, webpack.</li>
    <li>The animation displays transformation of figure depending on the phase difference changing in time.</li>
    <li>Set frequencies of X and Y motions using arrow buttons.</li>
    <li>Change speed with the 'X2' button.</li>
    <li>You can save and compare curves with Save button.</li>
